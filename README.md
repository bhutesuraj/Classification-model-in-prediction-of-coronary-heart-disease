## Implementation of a classification model in prediction of coronary heart disease - Course Project: Prof. Debashree Guha Adhya [Mar’22-Apr’22]


World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. 

The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications.

This work intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression. 

A classification model is build in MATLAB as well as in python using Logistic Regression and Regularized Logistic Regression to predict 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease in patients from the given classification data set.
